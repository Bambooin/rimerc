## History

When first coming into the Rime input methods, seeking for their **privacy and security**, but encountered lots of obstacles

Lack of UI settings and steep learning curve are very unfriendly for nobies, very eager to have an out of box solution

Come up with the idea of sharing configuration to help Rime community use it easily and efficiently

## Privacy

Input method as a necessary daily used software, the data involved is extremely **sensitive and privacy**, but most of current commercial input methods abuse of user's data and privacy

For people who pay attention to personal privacy, it is urgent to have a safe input method.
Rime meets these requirements, but lack of dictionary and configuration is very difficult for begginer, so share rimerc with the community
